# Lab 1: Introduction to R and RStudio

## Overall Goals

- Start RStudio.
- Learn the different screen areas in RStudio.
- Load a built-in dataset.
- Look at the help for the dataset.
- View the dataset in tabular form.
- Perform basic operations on dataset
    - Number of rows
    - Sort rows based on column
    - Simple graphs
    - Simple numerical summaries

## Specific R commands learned

- `data` for loading built-in data.
- `?` for asking for information on a function or data.
- `View` for a tabular look at dataset.
- `nrow` for number of rows.
- ...

## Lab 1

- Start RStudio (TODO: weblink)
- Panes:
    - Console
    - Environment/History
    - Outputs/Help/File
    - Document (Later)
- Create new project for counties
- Use "library(...)", "data(...)" to load the package that has the counties data (need to create it).
- (Not for student use: `read.table("https://skiadas.github.io/AppliedStatsCourse/site/datasets/countyComplete.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)`  )
- See the counties set on the right, click on it
- Data view comes up  -> document pane  (also View command)
- Sort view to find 3 most/least populous counties based on 2010
- How many counties? (3143, on left side)
- number of counties per state:
    - Numerically: `tally(~state, data=counties)`
        - Use upper arrow to repeat, then add: `%>% sort()`
        - Then add: `%>% barchart()`
    - Graphically: bargraph(~state, data=counties, horizontal = TRUE)
        - zoom graph
- Population of each state:
    - `sum(~pop2010|state, data=counties) %>% sort() %>% barchart()`
    - Maybe skip for later?
- Histogram of population by county:
    - `histogram(~pop2010, data=counties)`
    - `histogram(~pop2010, data=counties %>% filter(pop2010 <= 2e6))`
    - Add "breaks = 40"
    - `favstats(~pop2010, data=counties)`
- Histogram of percent of female population:
    - `histogram(~female, data=counties, breaks=40)`
    - `favstats(~female, data=counties)`
    - `bwplot(state~female, data=counties)`
        - Find lowest median, highest median
        - Find state with lowest outlier
    - Work with black and/or asian states
- Compare populations 2000, 2010:
    - `xyplot(pop2010~pop2000, data=counties)`
    - `xyplot(pop2010~pop2000, data=counties %>% filter(pop2000 < 2e6))`
    - `tally(~name, data=counties) %>% sort() %>% tail(10)`
- County names:
    - `tally(~name, data=counties) %>% sort() %>% tail(10)`
- Union counties:
    - `counties %>% filter(name=="Union County") %>% select(state)`
    - `summary`


Lab 3 or something:

To find percent of whites in state:
- white count per county
- add white counts across states
- divide white count by state pop count

counties %>% transmute(state = state, pop = pop2010, whitepop = pop2010 * white / 100) %>% group_by(state) %>% summarize(pop = sum(pop), whitepop = sum(whitepop)) %>% transmute(state = state, white = whitepop/pop * 100) %>% arrange(white)

Easier: sum(white*pop2010/100~state, data=counties)/sum(pop2010~state, data=counties) *100

sum(~black*pop2010/100, data=counties %>% filter(!is.na(black)))/sum(~pop2010, data=counties %>% filter(!is.na(black)))
